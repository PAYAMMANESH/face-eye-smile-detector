# Project: Face, Smile, and Eye Detection
# Overview of efforts
This project is designed for detecting faces, smiles, and eyes using OpenCV and Haar Cascade algorithms in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
# Software and Libraries



This project requires the following software and Python libraries:

### Software
- **Python**: A programming language used for this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

### Python Libraries
- **OpenCV**: OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision.
### Haar Cascade Files
- **haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml – for face detection**
- **haarcascade_eye.xml – for eye detection**
- **haarcascade_smile.xml – for smile detection**

# Starting the Project
- **Run Jupyter Notebook**
- **Open and Run the Notebook**: In Jupyter Notebook, open the file face-eye Detector.ipynb and run the code cells sequentially.
- **Provide Image Input**: In the code, provide the path to your image file. The code will automatically perform face, smile, and eye detection and display the results.
